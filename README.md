# Data-Jobs-company-size-classification

This is my first data science project and it is analyzing and classification of a data jobs according to company size dataset from kaggle 
the link of the dataset in kaggle -> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chopper53/data-engineer-salary-in-2024/data

# First step  
loading the dataset and performing cleaning and preprocessing to gain insights about the dataset and this step involved removing duplicate rows and removing  unnecessary rows.

# Second step 
Visualizing and gaining insights about the data.

# Third step
Preparing the data for machine learning classification algorithms

# fourth and final step
started the classification process and 'company_size' was the target variable using three algorithms : naive bayes classifier , Decision Tree classifier and k-nearest neigbour  classifier
and concluded that this dataset is good for classification.
